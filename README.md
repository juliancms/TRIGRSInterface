# TRIGRSInterface

Interface that facilitates data input for TRIGRS 2.0

## Description
TRIGRSInterface is an application that facilitates data entry for software TRIGRS 2.0. TRIGRS is a program that models the susceptibility of occurrence of shallow landslides in large areas of land triggered by rain. Within the input data used by TRIGRS there are geotechnical and hydrological variables, of which some can be maps. Also, it is required to enter data associated to the different maps and modeling methods allowed. However, the introduction of these inputs is changing numerical values in specific areas of txt files and writing in certain areas of the file path where the maps are. In addition, to introduce these input data a complicated training in the use of TRIGRS is required. Therefore, TRIGRSInterface is presented as a tool to facilitate the introduction of the input variables. It saves time in the introduction of these variables and facilitates the use of TRIGRS and also allows a greater number of users to use it without having the necessary training of how TRIGRS is used.
